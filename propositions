1. Have the method that checks if a meeting can be added, 'meetingCanBeAdded()', return an array of meetings it collides with
   if it does, and otherwise return null.
   
2. Add a GUI user interface menu, over the MeetingManager class. (not before we finish all basic requirements. Until then
   we can just have a text based menu)
